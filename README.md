# puppetlabs_comments
This is an example Puppet module. It contains both beaker and beaker-rpsec acceptance tests. 

The module uses a utility named beaker_testmodeSwitcher. This utility allows a user to switch between puppet apply on an agent to a puppet agent run on a master, with the use of a single ENV variable. 

The module is designed as a training tool. It's to show a very simple puppet module written in puppet DSL, and how the acceptance tests structure is defined.
